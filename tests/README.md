# Tests

Bun's built-in test runner (`bun test`). No third-party testing dependencies.

```

Run everything:

Run a layer:

```bash

## Unit test structure

Unit tests mirror `src/` one-to-one. Every module is small and (mostly) pure, so
each gets a sibling `*.test.ts`:

| Source                | Test                        | Covers                                             |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/core/parser.ts`  | `unit/core/parser.test.ts`  | `toParseArgsOptions`, `parseAndCoerce`             |
| `src/core/router.ts`  | `unit/core/router.test.ts`  | `buildRouteLookup`, `resolveRoute` (longest-match) |
| `src/io/colour.ts`    | `unit/io/colour.test.ts`    | `colourize` (NO_COLOR / FORCE_COLOR)               |
| `src/io/index.ts`     | `unit/io/index.test.ts`     | `createIo`, `createLogger`                         |
| `src/io/prompt.ts`    | `unit/io/prompt.test.ts`    | `prompt`, `confirm`, `select` (current stubs)      |
| `src/io/spinner.ts`   | `unit/io/spinner.test.ts`   | `createSpinner` (no-op handle shape)               |
| `src/utils/coerce.ts` | `unit/utils/coerce.test.ts` | `coerceValue`                                      |
| `src/utils/tty.ts`    | `unit/utils/tty.test.ts`    | `shouldUseColour`, `isTTY` (env precedence)        |

Type-only files under `src/types/` need no tests; they are exercised indirectly.
`prompt`/`spinner` are currently non-interactive stubs — their tests pin the stub
contract so a future real implementation becomes a deliberate, test-visible change.

## E2E test structure

E2E spawns the real CLI and asserts on argv → stdout/stderr/exit. Intended cases
live in `e2e/cli.e2e.test.ts` as `test.todo` because **there is no CLI entry point
yet**: `package.json` points at `main.ts`, which does not exist. The current
`src/` provides the primitives (parser, router, io, utils) but nothing wires them
into a runnable dispatcher. Once `main.ts` (or a `dist/` binary) lands, convert
the `test.todo`s into real `Bun.spawn` assertions. Suggested split as it grows:

- `e2e/dispatch.e2e.test.ts` — routing + positionals + unknown-command exit codes
- `e2e/flags.e2e.test.ts` — flag parsing/coercion, defaults, `--help`
- `e2e/io.e2e.test.ts` — colour env handling, stderr vs stdout

## Demo validation strategy

`demos/demos.test.ts` is a **single, generic, data-driven harness**, per the task.

**How a demo is validated:** as a black box. The harness spawns each demo's CLI
the way a user would (`bun run <demo>/main.ts <args>`), pipes stdin/env, and
asserts on **exit code + a few key output fragments** (substrings or regexes) —
never a byte-for-byte transcript.

**Why not hard-code full expected output in the test?** Full-string equality is
brittle: it breaks on ANSI colour, spinner frames, trailing whitespace, and
harmless wording changes — failures that say nothing about whether the demo works.

**Why not Bun snapshots (`toMatchSnapshot`)?** Zero-dependency, but snapshots
_rot_: someone runs `--update`, rubber-stamps a regression, and the expectation is
opaque in review. They also break on non-deterministic output.

**Chosen approach — declarative invariants + generic runner (no deps):** a small
`EXPECTATIONS` table lists, per demo, the minimal observable facts that prove each
command did its job. The runner is shared logic; the data is per-demo and
reviewable. Properties this buys us:

- **Minimal & scalable** — one test file; adding a demo = add a folder + a table
  entry. No new test code.
- **No silent coverage gaps** — the harness discovers every demo folder on disk and
  fails if one has no `EXPECTATIONS` entry (`every demo has an expectations entry`).
- **Robust** — `NO_COLOR=1` for stable output; substring/regex tolerates cosmetics.
- **Safe** — stateful demos (todo-app, project-init) run with a throwaway `$HOME`,
  so tests never touch the real machine.
- **Real** — exercises the actual CLI, not its internals.

### Status: passing

All demos now run against the real, manifest-based API and the harness is green.

History worth knowing: the demos were originally written against the API described
in `docs/` (a `Router` class with `router.command(...)`), which `src/` never
implemented — they failed to even import. They were rewritten to use the actual
primitives, and the missing dispatcher (present in the Phase 0 spike's `main.ts`,
dropped by a later refactor) was restored as **`src/core/runtime.ts`** — a `run()` +
`defineManifest()` pair that composes `resolveRoute` + `parseAndCoerce` + `createIo`.
Each demo now defines `CommandModule`s, builds a manifest inline, and calls `run()`.

Note: `docs/` still describes the old `Router` API and is out of sync with `src/`.
